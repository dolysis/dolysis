## The Big Three

To make a comparison I will use `C++` and `Perl`, this is purely to make an example and I chose these precisely to demonstrate the point and show that just because something follows these rules, that does not mean it is good or better.

### Simple should be Simple

To start and do something simple it should be easy and not require a complex configuration.

#### Example

    Print Hello World on the terminal.

```bash
# For C++


```

### Complex should be Possible

### Transition must be Easy
